Economics is concerned with the actions and interactions of economic agents as well as the functioning of economies. Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the fundamental parts of the economy, such as individual agents and markets, as well as their interactions and effects. Households, businesses, buyers, and sellers are all examples of individual agents. Macroeconomics studies the economy as a system in which production, consumption, saving, and investment interact, as well as the factors that influence it, such as the use of labor, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that affect these aspects.
