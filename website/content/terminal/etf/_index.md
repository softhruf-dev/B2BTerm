In recent years, exchange-traded funds have become one of the most essential and profitable products offered for individual investors. ETFs have a number of advantages and, when used properly, can help investors accomplish their investment objectives.

In a nutshell, an ETF is a collection of securities that may be purchased or sold on a stock exchange through a brokerage business. ETFs are available in almost every asset class imaginable, ranging from standard investments to so-called nontraditional assets such as commodities and currencies. Furthermore, new ETF formats enable investors to short markets, obtain leverage, and avoid paying short-term capital gains taxes.
