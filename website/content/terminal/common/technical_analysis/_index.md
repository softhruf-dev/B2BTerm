The study of financial market action is known as **Technical Analysis**. The technician examines price changes that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, or over any other fixed time period displayed graphically as charts. As a result, the term "chart analysis" was coined. A chartist merely looks at price charts, whereas a technical analyst looks at technical indications resulting from price changes as well. Instead of looking at the fundamental causes that (appear to) influence market prices, technical analysts look at how the financial markets behave. Even if all relevant information about a specific market or stock were accessible, technicians believe it would be impossible to forecast an exact market "reaction" to that information.
