Using the loaded ticker, the 'news' command will search articles and blogs with the [News API](https://newsapi.org) where the ticker symbol or company name are mentioned. Searches are limited to the past thirty days when using the free API key available. Searches may bring unwanted results when the ticker or business name contains words used as the Dictionary defines. Optional arguments can be added to the command string as described below.

  -n N_NUM, --num N_NUM
                        Number of latest news being printed.
