The Econometrics menu's purpose is to provide the user the ability to perform statistical research on custom datasets. 
The menu allows the user to load in his/her own dataset(s), modify the data by (for example) adding columns or setting 
indices, apply statistical tests (e.g. Breusch-Godfrey autocorrelation tests) as well as OLS regressions and Panel 
regressions (e.g. Random Effects and Fixed Effects)
