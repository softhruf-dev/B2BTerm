Fundamental analysis (FA) is a way of determining the intrinsic value of a securities by looking at connected economic and financial elements. Fundamental analysts look at everything that can influence the value of a security, from macroeconomic issues like the state of the economy and industry circumstances to microeconomic elements like the company's management performance.

The ultimate goal is to arrive at a number that can be compared to the present price of a security to determine whether it is undervalued or overvalued.
