A government is the system or collection of individuals in charge of governing a formally constituted community, such as a state. In its broadest sense, government is made up of three parts: legislature, executive branch, and judiciary. Government is both a tool of enforcing organizational policies and a system for defining policy. Many governments have a constitution, which is a statement of the government's guiding ideas and ideology.
