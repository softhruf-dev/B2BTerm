Options are in essence contracts between two parties that grant holders the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price within a certain time frame.

The underlying asset, which could be equities, bonds, currency, interest rates, market indexes, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or futures contracts, determines the value of an option. Options are securities in and of themselves, similar to stocks and bonds, but they are referred to as derivatives because their value is derived from something else.
