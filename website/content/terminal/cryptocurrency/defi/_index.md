DeFi (short for "decentralized finance") refers to financial services provided by public blockchains, most notably Ethereum. You can earn interest, borrow, lend, purchase insurance, trade derivatives, exchange assets, and more with DeFi, but it's faster and doesn't involve paperwork or a third party. DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (directly between two people, not through a centralized system), pseudonymous, and available to anyone, just like crypto in general.
