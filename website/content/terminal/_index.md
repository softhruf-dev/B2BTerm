### Why Python?

Python is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified syntax and shallow learning curve.
On top of this, it is highly used in data science and academia world (particularly on finance, economics
or business related degrees). This is very important, as it is the first time in history that users - regardless
of their background - can so easily add features to an investment research platform.

<--->

### Why Open Source?

An open source product allows for higher quality, greater reproducibility, lower costs, more transparency,
and faster go-to-market due to the strong community created. In addition, users can adapt the platform to their
needs or even build proprietary features on top of our infrastructure - which ultimately can result in a marketplace.

<--->

### Importing and Exporting data

The terminal allows for users to import their own proprietary datasets to use on our econometrics menu. In addition, users are allowed to export any type of data to any type of format whether that is raw data in Excel or an image in PNG. This is also ideal for finance content creation.

Or just create customizable notebook reports for your colleagues and friends doing research on a particular asset or a macroeconomic event impact on said asset. The possibilities are endless.
