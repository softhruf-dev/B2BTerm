The Gamestonk Terminal Bot is a mobile-friendly interactive social media chat bot for stock market information. Over 90 unique features callable through slash commands and auto-complete. No more typing commands or needing to refer to the documentation when you canâ€™t get the command right. !no.more.typos.and.errors!

Each feature includes a description and the ability to select optional arguments with point-and-click execution, so you can explore the possibilities of features with less friction. !stop.the.guessing today!
