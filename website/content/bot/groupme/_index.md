No installation or signup is required, nor is there a need to be in a server setting to use the bot. Any user call it through direct messaging / commands to: [t.me/GamestonkTerminalBot](https://t.me/GamestonkTerminalBot)
You can also invite the bot

Alternatively, the bot can be installed locally, or on a privately-hosted server, using the installation instructions found here:

https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/blob/main/bots/README.md

Learn how to use the GameStonksBot in less than five minutes, by reading the Introduction page.
