[Our personal bet on financial bots and how they will render other finance chatting tools useless.](https://twitter.com/gamestonkt/status/1501380282884268037)

TL;DR: We remove the need of you and your group of friends/colleagues migrating to any chatting tool to use the the terminal capabilities. Instead, our Gamestonk Terminal Bot will seamlessly integrate with your already existing conversations/chats/servers.

## Discord Bot

We will go in detail regarding the commands within [Discord Bot](/GamestonkTerminal/bots/discord/).

However, for the other chatting platforms, we will just list the main differences as the commands are expected to be invoked in the same manner.

**Supported bots:**

- [Telegram](/GamestonkTerminal/bots/telegram/)
- [Slack](/GamestonkTerminal/bots/slack/)
- [GroupMe](/GamestonkTerminal/bots/groupme/)
