The purpose of the Financial Chatting bots are to remove the need of you and your group of friends /colleagues
migrating to any chatting tool to use the terminal capabilities. Instead, our OpenBB Terminal Bot will seamlessly
integrate with your already existing conversations/chats/servers.

### Discord, Telegram, Slack and GroupMe integration

The only cross-platform financial chatting bot to accommodate for your already existing groups/chats/servers.
We will go in detail regarding the commands within [Discord Bot](/OpenBBTerminal/bots/discord/).
However, for the other chatting platforms, we will just list the main differences as
the commands are expected to be invoked in the same manner.

<--->

### Investment data should be OS agnostic

This bot will allow to access the terminal features using any type of device. From mobile phone to tablet and computer.

### Use bot for your own investment research

If you don't want to engage with the bot in an open-server setting, you can message the bot directly and interact with data on a more private setting.

<--->

### Customize the bot to your needs

The bot also benefits from an MIT Open Source license, which means that you can customize it according to your needs and include proprietary features.
