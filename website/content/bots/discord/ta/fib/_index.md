ta fib - shows Fibonacci levels for a stock.

Fibonacci retracement levels are horizontal lines that indicate where support and resistance are likely to occur. They stem from Fibonacciâ€™s sequence, a mathematical formula that originated in the 13th century.

Each level is associated with a percentage. The percentage is how much of a prior move the price has retraced. The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not officially a Fibonacci ratio, 50% is also used.
