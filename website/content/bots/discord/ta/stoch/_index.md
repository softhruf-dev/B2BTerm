ta-mom stoch - Stochastic Oscillator

The Stochastic Oscillator measures where the close is in relation to the recent trading range. The values range from zero to 100. %D values over 75 indicate an overbought condition; values under 25 indicate an oversold condition. When the Fast %K crosses above the Slow %D, it is a buy signal; when it crosses below, it is a sell signal. The Raw %K is generally considered too erratic to use for crossover signals.
