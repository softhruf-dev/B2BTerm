# CRYPTOCURRENCY

This menu aims to explore crypto world, and the usage of the following commands along with an example will be exploited below.

Note that we have added the ability to look at technical analysis in the ta menu.  Data loaded from CoinGecko has no candle data,
so indicators that rely on anything other than close will fail with an error.
