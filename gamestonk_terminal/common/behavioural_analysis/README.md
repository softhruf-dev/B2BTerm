# TWITTER <a name="TWITTER"></a>

Uses VADER sentiment.  VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment
analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

The output of VADER analysis :

```text
The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the
rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most
useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized,
 weighted composite score' is accurate.
```

A sample tweet is shown below along with what the VADER polarity scores are.

```text
Have some $SENS  üöÄüèÜ\nüëâFDA approval coming very soon, üëâNews is out, amazing test results. \nüëâVery high short
interest rate. \nüëâMajor short squeeze coming. \n\n$amc $gme $nakd $ctrm $tsla $aapl $oeg $aht $bbby $bb $fsr $spce

```

This gives the following scores:

```python

> sentiment metrics powered by proprietary NLP models.

## Metric definitions

### AHI (Absolute Hype Index) <a name="AHI"></a>

AHI is a measure of how much people are talking about a stock on social media.
It is calculated by dividing the total number of mentions for the chosen stock
on a social network by the mean number of mentions any stock receives on that
social medium.

### RHI (Relative Hype Index) <a name="RHI"></a>

RHI is a measure of whether people are talking about a stock more or less than
usual, calculated by dividing the mean AHI for the past day by the mean AHI for
for the past week for that stock.

### Sentiment Score <a name="sentiment"></a>

Sentiment score is the percentage of people talking positively about the stock.
For each social network the number of positive posts/comments is divided by the
total number of both positive and negative posts/comments.

### SGP (Standard General Perception) <a name="SGP"></a>

SGP is a measure of whether people are more or less positive about a stock than
usual. It is calculated by averaging the past day of sentiment values and then
dividing it by the average of the past week of sentiment values.
