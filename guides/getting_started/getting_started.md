**Important Rules**

Each page should always take the following rules in mind:
- We take a neutral position for everything we show. We don’t say things like ‘This is a good way to’ or ‘This is the gold standard’ or anything similar. These guides are not meant for any form of financial advice, conclusions or perceptions of the market. That is what we can use any social media platform for and write on your own account.
- The page is formal. We don’t include any type of jokes, memes or sarcasm/rhetoric comments. 
- We do not explain any financial term but refer to a different source, e.g. Investopedia.
- The purpose of the guide is not to educate the user about how to invest but to explain how to navigate a menu.

**General Formatting**

- Every link should open a new page (`_blank`). So use: `<a href="https://openbb-finance.github.io/OpenBBTerminal/terminal/stocks/options/exp/" target="_blank">exp</a>`
- Some methods to format images:
  - Side by side: `<img src="image1.png" width="425"/> <img src="image2.png" width="425"/>`
  - Text and image:
    ```
    <table border="0">
     <tr>
        <td><b style="font-size:30px">TEXT TITLE</b></td>
        <td><b style="font-size:30px">IMAGE TITLE</b></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>TEXT</td>
        <td>IMAGE</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
    ```
  - No formatting in particular: `![image](link/to/image)`
